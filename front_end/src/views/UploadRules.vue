Frequent power outages and an inconsistent water supply have adversely affected the learning environment and daily operations. As per the regulations, every school must have access to a reliable power supply (Regulation 10) and a sufficient water supply (Regulation 11) that meets all relevant legal and functional requirements. I urge the relevant authorities to conduct a thorough review and expedite necessary interventions to bring our infrastructure in line with these essential standards. Thank you for your immediate attention to this critical matter. Yours faithfully, Mr. Thabo Mokoena Operations Manager Lakeside Community School"
